Arduino-Controlled Tetris Game
This project is a replica of the classic Tetris game built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the Arduino IDE (C++), with added support for a physical joystick controller. High scores are calculated and tracked within the game, creating a fun and competitive experience.

🕹️ Controller Setup (Arduino + Joystick)
The game can be controlled using either a keyboard or a joystick connected to an Arduino. The joystick acts as a real-world game controller and connects using the following pin configuration:

VRx → A0

VRy → A1

SW (Button) → Digital Pin 2

GND → GND

VCC (Power) → 5V

Once the Arduino sketch is uploaded, the joystick inputs are sent via serial communication to the game, allowing smooth directional control and button-based actions.

🧠 Features
